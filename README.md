Project Name: Recent Dengue Outbreak of Bangladesh: Prediction and Analysis by Artificial Intelligence with a Time Series Approach

An important concern to public health exists in many tropical and subtropical areas because dengue fever is a virus spread by mosquitoes. The recent outbreak of Dengue became alarming and months have been deadly. To lessen the effects of dengue outbreaks, early forecasting, and strong preventative actions are essential. Using machine learning methods like SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, along with time series forecasting approaches, this research attempts to construct a strong predictive model for dengue occurrence. In Logistic Regression, 100% is the greatest predicted accuracy score. And 90% to 95% accuracy is projected for the other classifiers. The LSTM approach provides good time series forecasting with improved train and validation score accuracy. To build a comprehensive dataset suited for predictive modeling, the suggested method incorporates historical dengue incidence data, meteorological data, and other pertinent factors. To help future researchers, engineers, and the people affected area to create awareness among them.
